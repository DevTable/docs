Quay.io has a maximum capacity for requests per second per IP address.
If you are getting a response with the [429 status code](http://httpstatusdogs.com/429-too-many-requests), you have exceeded this capacity.

### I'm not using the site or client much, but still receiving 429s

Please [contact support](mailto:support@quay.io) in order for us to determine the root cause of the issue.
