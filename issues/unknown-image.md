You are attempting a V1 rgistry push or pull, and an image with the given ID was not found.

### The docker push got out of sync

Please try to push the repository again. If the problem persists, please [contact support](https://quay.io/contact).

### You are using an old version of Docker

Older versions of Docker do not have built-in support for the [V2 registry protocol](https://docs.docker.com/registry/spec/api/). Please upgrade docker to the latest version.
