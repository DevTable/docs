To create a repository on Quay.io, you must use an authenticated user or [robot account](/glossary/robot-accounts.html).

### I am not signed into Quay.io in the docker CLI

{% include login.md %}

### I do not have a user account

To create a new user, visit the [Sign Up](https://quay.io/signin) page and fill out the form under 'Create Account'.
